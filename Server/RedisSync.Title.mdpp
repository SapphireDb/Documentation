# SapphireDb.RedisSync - Redis sync module for SapphireDb

SapphireDb supports running in multiple instances. Each instance will synchronize with the other instances using different mechanisms.

If you want to scale dynamically you don't know the instances in advance. You therefor need a kind of message broker that distributes changes to all application instances. 

SapphireDb.RedisSync provides functionality that uses Redis to achieve this goal.
