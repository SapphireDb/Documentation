# SapphireDb.HttpSync - Http sync module for SapphireDb

SapphireDb supports running in multiple instances. Each instance will synchronize with the other instances using different mechanisms.

If you only have a predefined (and small) number of instances and don't need dynamic scaling you can use this option. SapphireDb will sync changes through a http-interface and send them to all other known instances.
